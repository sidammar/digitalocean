Notes to be read by the reviewer.

1. I have understood the assignment and created a guide on the same. Please note that there was already a guide on the DigitalOcean platform but some of the commands were not working so I updated and modified some of them.

2. I had reveiwed the DigitalOcean writing guidelines and drafted my guide accordingly. I also made sure to use the required markdown format and also installed the do-markitdown plugin for more clarity on the process. However I did not showcase it here as it was not a requirement.

3. My primary focus as mentioned was on conveying technical information to the user with as simply as possible while reaching the desired outcome.

4. Due to the time constraint of 3 Hours - I only did the install part and did not proceed further. I spend mt time on understanding the requirements, guidelines, drafting the copy, simplyfying it, adding all commands, formatting them and subsequently testing them on a DigitalOcean droplet.
